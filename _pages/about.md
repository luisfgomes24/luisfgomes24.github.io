## Luís F. Gomes

I am a PhD student in Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Porto, co-advised by [Rui Abreu](https://www.ruimaranhao.com), [Jonathan Aldrich](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/), and [Vincent Hellendoorn](https://vhellendoorn.github.io/).
I am currently a visiting researcher at Singapore Management University, working with [David Lo](https://faculty.smu.edu.sg/profile/david-lo-901).

My research lies at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Software Engineering (AI4SE)**, where I build tools to help developers better understand and interact with complex software systems. I’m particularly interested in **Developers' Productivity**, **Human-AI interaction**, and **Empirical Software Engineering**.

Send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/luisgomes24) or [Email](mailto:lfgomes@andrew.cmu.edu). 

### 🔬 Research Interests

- **AI-powered developer tools**  
  Creating intelligent assistants that support coding, design, and documentation (visually and interactively).

- **Sketching and Visual Assistants**  
  Studying how developers use informal sketches in ML workflows, and building tools that convert these sketches into executable code and back.
- **Empirical software engineering**  
  Running user studies and empirical evaluations to understand developer behavior and validate tool usability.


### 🎓 **Education**

- **PhD in Software Engineering**, Carnegie Mellon University / University of Porto  
  CMU Portugal Dual-Degree Program (2021–2026)

- **BSc + MSc in Computer Science**, University of Minho  
  Artificial Intelligence and Data Science
